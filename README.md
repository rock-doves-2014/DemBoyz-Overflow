##Concept:

Since the execution of the shuffle “DemBoyz” were created.

We realized we had a lot to offer with our “overflow” of

knowledge (or lack thereof) and decided we wanted to give

back and get back from the community... thus we are

pioneering a new concept where you can post question and

find answers. We have brought the village elder concept

online!
